# Project Proposal

## Team members:
- Abar Madaminov
- Du Tham Lieu
- Eshan Shagaei

## Project Topic:
Activity recognition using Machine Learning

## Project description
Using machine learning model to recognize activities through data from sensors

What will we implement: A model that classify the activities given data from sensor

Sensors: Accelometer, gyroscope

Activities: Body activity status

Recognition: Detection

Data we will use:
- [test.csv.zip](https://github.com/pierrepicaud/human-activity-recognition-dataset/blob/main/test.csv.zip)
- [train.csv.zip](https://github.com/pierrepicaud/human-activity-recognition-dataset/blob/main/train.csv.zip)

Expected result:
A notebook that shows the implemented model
