## Project Topic:
Human Activity Recognition based on Accelerometer and
Gyrosope data

## Project description
Our Goal is to compare performance of different learning methods in classifying human activities, based on the data collected from the sensors(e.g accelerometer and gyroscope). The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. Initially our plan is to analyse the data and obtain a model with classical ML methods(e.g SVN). Furthermore we would like to implement various different methoes such as RNNs(e.g LSTM), CNN and DNN and compare the performance, memory, accuracy, AUC and other significant metrics.

What will we implement: Several models that classify the activities given data from sensor

Sensors: Accelometer, gyroscope

Activities: Body activity status

Recognition: Recognition

Data we will use:
- [test.csv.zip](https://github.com/pierrepicaud/human-activity-recognition-dataset/blob/main/test.csv.zip)
- [train.csv.zip](https://github.com/pierrepicaud/human-activity-recognition-dataset/blob/main/train.csv.zip)

Expected result:
A notebook that shows the implemented model
